This repository contains the source code for the SCFirstOrderLogic.Inference.Abstractions NuGet package.

## Package Documentation

For documentation on using the NuGet package, see https://sdcondon.net/SCFirstOrderLogic/.

## Source Documentation

I have not written up any documentation of the source (e.g. repo overview, build guidance, contribution guidelines) - and likely won't unless someone else expresses an interest in contributing.
Once cloned, it should "just work" as far as compilation is concerned.

## Issues and Contributions

I'm not expecting anyone to want to get involved given the low download figures on NuGet, but please feel free to do so.
I do keep an eye on the [issues](https://github.com/sdcondon/SCFirstOrderLogic.Inference.Abstractions/issues) tab, and will add a CONTRIBUTING.md if anyone drops me a message expressing interest.
